        <h2>NUS Statistics (2006â€“2011)</h2>
        <p>
          Iâ€™ve always found comfort in numbers. There was something satisfying
          about how clear-cut it all was â€” as long as I put in the work to
          understand the concepts and practise, results would follow. This led
          me to read statistics in school. My final-year project involved
          projecting child mortality rates to identify countries at risk of
          missing the UNâ€™s Millennium Development Goals. This experience sparked
          my interest in making meaningful contributions to society, which
          ultimately led me to pursue a career in the public sector.

          Ministry of Trade and Industry â€” North East Asia Division (2011â€“2015)
        </h2>
        <p>
          I started off working on the Suzhou Industrial Park portfolio before
          moving on to help launch Singaporeâ€™s 3rd Government to Government
          Collaboration with China - the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative (CCI)
          project in 2013. Those years were intense â€” I still joke with
          ex-colleagues that I could never go back to the way we worked back
          then. Endless staffing, red-eye flights, and a particularly
          unforgettable meeting at Chinaâ€™s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) that
          ran until 5am the next day.
          <br />
          Despite the long hours, the work was fulfilling and exciting â€” I got
          to witness the early stages of a key project from concept to launch,
          and had the privilege of being at the forefront of several high-level
          meetings. I still remember the moment our leaders signed the MOU to
          officially launch the CCI during Xiâ€™s State Visit to Singapore in Nov
          2014 â€” it felt like everything weâ€™d poured into the project had come
          full circle. That said, I was also feeling a tad consumed with work by
          then, and decided it was time for a break.

        <h2>At the Five-Year Mark: Sabbatical (2H 2015)</h2>
        <p>
          At the end of the fifth year into the corporate world, I found myself
          asking: What is Godâ€™s calling for me? Am I truly living it out? I took
          my first sabbatical â€” a month in the U.S. with my aunt, a three-month
          ministry programme at Tung Ling Bible School, and a month in France
          visiting a friend.
          <br />
          During that time, I reflected on Godâ€™s calling. Through the programme
          and books I read, I was reminded that our primary calling as
          Christians is to love God and His people. Beyond that, Iâ€™ve come to
          believe that God honours our talents and desires, using our
          experiences to shape us for His purposes. Work still needs to be
          meaningful, but I now know it canâ€™t be the be-all and end-all.

        <h2>MTI Energy Division (2016â€“2019)</h2>
        <p>
          The numbers itch never quite went away, so I chose a posting in the
          Energy Division, hoping to take on more quantitative work. My main
          responsibilities included projecting Singaporeâ€™s energy demand and
          working on energy infrastructure financing â€” think LNG terminals and
          long-term supply planning.
          <br />
          Work-life balance was a lot better in ED (we were, after all, voted
          the happiest division in MTI in a HR survey one year ðŸ˜›). Still, I
          found myself craving deeper quantitative work and wanted to sharpen my
          skills. So I took the plunge and enrolled in a full-time data science
          bootcamp to make a proper shift into a data-driven role.

        <h2>General Assembly â€“ Data Science Immersive Bootcamp (2H 2019)</h2>
        <p>
          I enjoyed the pace and structure of learning again, though it came
          with its share of self-doubt â€” especially stepping into a new field in
          my early 30s. It was a season of intense hustle, shared with
          like-minded classmates equally determined to make the leap into data
          science.

        <h2>GovTech â€“ Data Science & AI Division (2020â€“2025)</h2>
        <p>
          Found myself wearing multiple hats, working across different domains
          including data science and AI, data management and sales person. My
          background in policy helped bridge technical work with real-world
          impact, especially when navigating stakeholder needs and defining
          success metrics.
          <br />
          Key areas included data governance, agile delivery (Scrum), and early
          adoption of large language models (LLMs). Across projects, the
          consistent focus was on delivering meaningful, measurable outcomes.

        <h2>GA Software Engineering Immersive (1H 2025)</h2>
        <p>
          I decided to take up software engineering to round out my skill set â€”
          and Iâ€™m thankful for supportive bosses. Iâ€™m currently midway through
          the course and loving it. Our first project was a game, and it was
          wicked fun.
          <br />
          Compared to data science, software engineering feels more immediate â€”
          you can start building right away, without the initial overhead of
          finding and cleaning data. Itâ€™s a refreshing, creative change of pace.
          Who knows â€” maybe one day Iâ€™ll build my own indie PokÃ©mon game. ðŸ˜›
