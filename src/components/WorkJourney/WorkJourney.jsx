          Iâ€™ve always found comfort in numbers. There was something satisfying
          about how clear-cut it all was â€” as long as I put in the work to
          understand the concepts and practise, results would follow. This led
          me to read statistics in school. My final-year project involved
          projecting child mortality rates to identify countries at risk of
          missing the UNâ€™s Millennium Development Goals. This experience sparked
          my interest in making meaningful contributions to society, which
          ultimately led me to pursue a career in the public sector.

              I started off working on the Suzhou Industrial Park portfolio
              before moving on to help launch Singaporeâ€™s 3rd Government to
              Government Collaboration with China - the Chongqing Connectivity
              Initiative (CCI) project in 2013. Those years were intense â€” I
              still joke with ex-colleagues that I could never go back to the
              way we worked back then. Endless staffing, red-eye flights, and a
              particularly unforgettable meeting at Chinaâ€™s Ministry of Commerce
              (MOFCOM) that ran until 5am the next day.
              <br />
              <br />
              Despite the long hours, the work was fulfilling and exciting â€” I
              got to witness the early stages of a key project from concept to
              launch, and had the privilege of being at the forefront of several
              high-level meetings. I still remember the moment our leaders
              signed the MOU to officially launch the CCI during Xiâ€™s State
              Visit to Singapore in Nov 2014 â€” it felt like everything weâ€™d
              poured into the project had come full circle. That said, I was
              also feeling a tad consumed with work by then, and decided it was
              time for a break.

          At the end of the fifth year into the corporate world, I found myself
          asking: What is Godâ€™s calling for me? Am I truly living it out? I took
          my first sabbatical â€” a month in the U.S. with my aunt, a three-month
          ministry programme at Tung Ling Bible School, and a month in France
          visiting a friend.
          <br />
          <br />
          During that time, I reflected on Godâ€™s calling. Through the programme
          and books I read, I was reminded that our primary calling as
          Christians is to love God and His people. Beyond that, Iâ€™ve come to
          believe that God honours our talents and desires, using our
          experiences to shape us for His purposes. Work still needs to be
          meaningful, but I now know it canâ€™t be the be-all and end-all.

              The numbers itch never quite went away, so I chose a posting in
              the Energy Division, hoping to take on more quantitative work. My
              main responsibilities included projecting Singaporeâ€™s energy
              demand and working on energy infrastructure financing â€” think LNG
              terminals and long-term supply planning.
              <br />
              <br />
              Work-life balance was a lot better in ED (we were, after all,
              voted the happiest division in MTI in a HR survey one year ðŸ˜›).
              Still, I found myself craving deeper quantitative work and wanted
              to sharpen my skills. So I took the plunge and enrolled in a
              full-time data science bootcamp to make a proper shift into a
              data-driven role.

              I enjoyed the pace and structure of learning again, though it came
              with its share of self-doubt â€” especially stepping into a new
              field in my early 30s. It was a season of intense hustle, shared
              with like-minded classmates equally determined to make the leap
              into data science.

          Found myself wearing multiple hats, working across different domains
          including data science and AI, data management and sales person. My
          background in policy helped bridge technical work with real-world
          impact, especially when navigating stakeholder needs and defining
          success metrics.
          <br />
          <br />
          Key areas included data governance, agile delivery (Scrum), and early
          adoption of large language models (LLMs). Across projects, the
          consistent focus was on delivering meaningful, measurable outcomes.

          I decided to take up software engineering to round out my skill set â€”
          and Iâ€™m thankful for supportive bosses. Iâ€™m currently midway through
          the course and loving it. Our first project was a game, and it was
          wicked fun.
          <br />
          <br />
          Compared to data science, software engineering feels more immediate â€”
          you can start building right away, without the initial overhead of
          finding and cleaning data. Itâ€™s a refreshing, creative change of pace.
          Who knows â€” maybe one day Iâ€™ll build my own indie PokÃ©mon game. ðŸ˜›
